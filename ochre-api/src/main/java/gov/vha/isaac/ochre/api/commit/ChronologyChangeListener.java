/**
 * Observable update rules: 
 * 1. A Chronology update will be sent to the ObservableChronology with the 
 * same nid, to update the contents of the ObservableChronology, if it is 
 * in memory. 
 * 
 * 2. A SememeChronology update will be sent to the ObservableConceptChronology
 * of it's assemblage if it is in memory. If it is in memory, and the ObservableList
 * of the assemblage's sememes is is memory, then the observable sememe list will 
 * be properly updated. 
 * 
 * 3. A SememeChronology update will be sent to the ObservableChronology of the referenced
 * component if it is in memory, and will update the sememe for component ObservableList
 * if it is instantiated. 
 * 
 * 4. A SememeChronology update will be sent to the taxonomy manager. The taxonomy
 * manager will check for updated to the stated and inferred taxonomy. 
 * 
 * 5. A SememeChronology update will be sent to the LogicService. The logic service
 * will determine if changes impact incremental or fully classified data, and will update 
 * the logic status accordingly.
